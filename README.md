# Linux Kernel Study

## Overview
Hands-on study of Linux kernel internals and low-level system programming using an AWS EC2 environment.

## Environment
- Ubuntu on AWS EC2
- Kernel build with `make menuconfig`
- Kernel module testing
- Remote SSH development

## What I am doing
- Building and configuring Linux kernel
- Studying printk and kernel logging
- Understanding system internals
- Practicing low-level debugging

## Goal
To develop strong understanding of operating system internals, cloud infrastructure, and distributed systems.

This project is part of my long-term focus on:
- Cloud architecture
- System design
- Low-level performance
